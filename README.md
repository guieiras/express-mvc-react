# Express MVC Boilerplate

Basic MVC application using Express, Sequelize and Pug.

## Features

- Convention

Create a `Controller.js` file on "controllers" folder and it is ready to be used on a route.
Create a `.js` Sequelize file on "models" folder and it is ready to be used on the application.
Set routes using object notation and get time and readability during development.

- Simple configuration

Don't worry about configuration. Just get a coffee and start creating Sequelize models, Controller classes and Pug views as ever. Everything is autoloaded on server startup.

- Routes

Don't get lost on your app routes. There is just one file to declare them.

*routes.js* sample

```javascript
module.exports = {
  '/' : {
    controller: 'IndexController',
    children: [{ method: 'get', path: '/', action: 'index' }]
  },
  '/entities' : {
    controller: 'EntitiesController',
    children: [
      { method: 'get', path: '/', action: 'index' },
      { method: 'get', path: '/:id', action: 'show' },
      { method: 'post', path: '/', action: 'create' },
      { method: 'put', path: '/:id', action: 'update' },
      { method: 'delete', path: '/:id', action: 'destroy' }
    ]
  }
}
```
